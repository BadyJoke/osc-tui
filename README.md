# osc-cli-curses

Designed to be a POC of a Cockpit inside the terminal (with less features: only every-days ones such as boot, reboot...).<br/>The officially supported python version is currently 3.6.<br/> It is currently not compatible with python 3.7 because of the lib npyscreen used.<br/> The code is currently a bit dirty... Maybe big changes are coming! Feel free to suggest oher architectures, libs...
