# osc-cli-curses

Designed to be a POC of a Outscale's Cockpit inside the terminal (with less features: only every-days ones such as boot, reboot...).<br/>The officially supported python version is currently 3.6.<br/> It is currently not compatible with python 3.7 because of the lib npyscreen used.<br/> The code is currently a bit dirty... Maybe big changes are coming! Feel free to suggest oher architectures, libs...<br/>The `src/` folder contains the project's sources.<br/>The `tests/` folder contain some crappy code used to test API calls or any other things...
